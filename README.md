DH150: User Experience Design

## Project Description
### Summary:
My user research project focuses on creating a quick, less frustrating, and more user-friendly online shopping experience for Amazon. While Amazon is a very well-known and widely-used website, there is large room for improvement for its user experience, especially in terms of accessibility, consistency, and functionality. The community of Amazon users is large, however, to accomodate users with less technological experience, Amazon needs a way to connect with their users quickly and directly. Through my user research and designs, I hope to make Amazon shopping experience faster, but still enjoyable for users, and make help on the website more accessible and personal. 

### Persona and Features:
According to my user research, I created three personas to highlight and find potential resolutions to issues in the current Amazon user experience design. The first persona is Austin Chen, a college student who wants to purchase exercise equipment from the comfort of his dorm room. He does not have a specific piece of equipment in mind and hopes to quickly browse Amazon's choices to find the perfect product. In order to make the broad range of search results more organized, I propose a feature in which Amazon will organize similar products into categories, making it easy for Austin to see what kinds of general products/exercise equipment is available on Amazon. The second persona is Chelsea Smith, a stay-at-home mom who needs to find a dress for a baby shower. She has specific details about the dress she wants - such as the color, price, and size of the dress. In order to narrow down Amazon's searches to only show the products that fit Chelsea's preferences, I propose a feature in which Amazon organizes their filters in drop-down menus so Chelsea will be able to clearly see all of the filters available and only have to change the filters she wants to manipulate. The third persona is Mary Benson, a retired teacher and new Amazon user who needs to return a laptop charger. She needs help processing her return. I propose a feature to make the help page more obvious and easily accessible so that new users can find help quickly without frustration.

Here is a summary of the three features in my following designs:

1. Categorical organization of search results

2. Concise filter settings 

3. Easy-access help page with contact information to Amazon

### Purpose:
The purpose of my low-fidelity prototypes is to check and test the functionality of my new designs. It allows me to translate my high-level design concepts into physical and tangible entities that other people can interact with in order to identify flaws in functionality. My low-fidelity prototype is used to test how the features I proposed flow within a user's online shopping experience, and focuses on its practicality rather than visual appearance. 

## Tasks
The low-fidelity prototype supports the following tasks:

1. Select Help

2. Search for help

3. Input search field

4. Narrow down search results using filters

5. Narrow down search results using categories

6. Select product
